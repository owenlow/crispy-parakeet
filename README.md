# ORW - Owen's Rust Webserver

### Summary

Hack project to learn about Rust. Hosts pages as template files in the `/pages` directory.

### Usage

First, install dependencies:
```shell
$ cargo build 
```

Then start the server:

```shell
$ cargo run
```

### TODO

Add some sort of controller support. It was out of scope for the hackathon.
